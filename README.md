## React.Js Expense Tracker
Just playing around with some React.Js features. In this repo, I work on a simple expense tracker;
-   Add a new Expense with a title, date and description
-   Edit, Delete or Update recoerds

All data is lost on reload (It's not saved anywhere rather than an array data structure).

## How to run this project
-   Clone the repo
-   Run `yarn` to install dependencies or `npm install` (I recommend yarn)
-   Finally, run `yarn start` to start the development server
